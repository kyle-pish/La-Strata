# La Strata — Homepage

This is a simple starter homepage for the La Strata mobile charcuterie cart.

Files added:

- `index.html` — main page with header, menu button, and hero
- `styles.css` — styles for layout and overlay
- `script.js` — toggles the menu open/closed
- `assets/logo.svg` — placeholder logo
- `assets/hero.svg` — placeholder hero image

Preview locally by opening `index.html` in your browser, for example:

```bash
open "index.html"
```

If you'd like, I can:

- Replace the SVG assets with uploaded images you provide
- Add animations, more sections (About/Menu/Contact), or a contact form
- Wire up a simple CMS or Netlify deploy configuration
